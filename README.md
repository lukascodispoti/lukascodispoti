### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### :man_technologist: About Me :
I am a doctoral candidate in computational fluid dynamics at ETH ZÃ¼rich, where I develop large-scale parallel numerical applications as well as machine learning models to study turbulence and novel LES models. 

What I most enjoy is solving very difficult programs and writing code to do just that.

I mainly code in C and C++ and heavily use mpi, hdf5 and fftw.

My main interests are computational science, artificial intelligence and energy topics.
