## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lukas Codispoti.
I am a computational scientist with a background in mechanical engineering and a passion for programming.
My main interests are numerical simulations, fluid dynamics and artificial intelligence.
In my current role as doctoral student in computational fluid dynamics at ETH ZÃ¼rich
I develop highly efficient numerical applications with tools like `mpi`, `hdf5` and `fftw` and
perform large-scale simulations on HPC clusters to study particle-laden turbulence.

I also generate beautiful images like this one:
